NAME
	Fun4All_G4_Jets/ -- minimum working example for a G4 jet analysis in sPHENIX

DESCRIPTION
	these files are meant to give a minimum working example
	on how to get a jet analysis working with sPHENIX GEANT4
	simulation software. it may also help with learning some
	ROOT stuff, if you are just starting on that.
	
	.

	|-- hepmc.dat
	`-- logfile
	
	Fiddle.C is the most important file.
	interperting it via
		
		$ root Fiddle.C
	
	generates the ROOT output file g4jeteval.root
	the file logfile contains the stdout/stderr
	that i got when interperting Fiddle.C
		
		$ root Fiddle.C >& logfile
	
	getTuples.C is a macro that describes the contents
	of g4jeteval.root and demonstrates how you might
	go about doing analysis on the data. this is where
	the ROOT tips live. run it like
	
	hepmc.dat is a HepMC data file, containing 1,000 events
	produced by PYTHIA for hard QCD processes.
	Fiddle.C analyses only 20, however, 'cause sPHENIX's
	GEANT4 simulations take forever to run, at the moment.
	G4_HcalIn.C and G4_Svtx.C are standard sPHENIX GEANT4
	detector description macros that are loaded by Fiddle.C
	...you do not need to look inside of them.
	
	i recommend
	(1) making sure that you can reproduce g4jeteval.root,
	    especially since some of the core libraries
	    may have been changed since i wrote this.
	(2) screwing with Fiddle.C and getTuples.C
