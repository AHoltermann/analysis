NAME
	Fun4All_Pythia8/ -- minimum working example for using PYTHIA8 in sPHENIX

DESCRIPTION
	these files are meant to give a minimum working example
	on how to get PYTHIA working with sPHENIX software.
	
	.
	|-- Fiddle.C
	|-- Fiddle_OUT.dat
	|-- README
	|-- logfile
	`-- phpythia8.cfg
	
	Fiddle.C is the most important file.
	interperting it via
		
		$ root Fiddle.C
	
	generates the HepMC output file Fiddle_OUT.dat
	the file logfile contains the stdout/stderr
	that i got when interperting Fiddle.C
		
		$ root Fiddle.C >& logfile
	
	phpythia.cfg is a PYTHIA8 config file
	that Fiddle.C reads to know what to do.
	
	i recommend
	(1) making sure that you can reproduce Fiddle_OUT.dat
	(2) screwing with phpythia8.cfg
