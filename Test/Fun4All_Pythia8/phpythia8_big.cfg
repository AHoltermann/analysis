!!! here, crap is organized thematically.
!!! to search taxonomically, use e.g.
!!! 	
!!! 	$ grep phpythia8.cfg -e "^!\?Main:"
!!! 
!!! this is not a complete list of settings.
!!! for that, check out...
!!! 	
!!! 	http://home.thep.lu.se/~torbjorn/pythia81html/MainProgramSettings.html
!!! 	http://home.thep.lu.se/~torbjorn/pythia81html/BeamParameters.html
!!! 	http://home.thep.lu.se/~torbjorn/pythia81html/PDFSelection.html
!!! 	http://home.thep.lu.se/~torbjorn/pythia81html/ProcessSelection.html
!!! 	...et cetera.
!!!
!!! also, a warning:
!!! i have not run with all these parameters;
!!! i just looked over the documentation and
!!! copied down some interesting-looking
!!! settings. some i did test.

!!! PIDs of the two beams e.g. p 2212, e- 11, mu- 13
!!! lepton/hadron combos are NOT allowed ... yet.
Beams:idA = 2212
Beams:idB = 2212

!!! center-of-mass energy (GeV)
Beams:eCM = 200.

!!! if you are feeling like mixing it up...
!Beams:eA = 7000.
!Beams:eB = 7000.

!!! you can also allow the beams a momentum spread
!Beams:allowMomentumSpread = on
!Beams:sigmaPxA = 0.1
!Beams:sigmaPyA = 0.1
!Beams:sigmaPzA = 4.
!Beams:maxDevA = 5.
!Beams:sigmaPxB = 0.1
!Beams:sigmaPyB = 0.1
!Beams:sigmaPzB = 4.
!Beams:maxDevB = 5.

!!! configure the collision vertex (millimeters)
!Beams:offsetVertexX = 0.
!Beams:offsetVertexY = 0.
!Beams:offsetVertexZ = 0.
!Beams:offsetTime = 0. !<------ mm/c
!Beams:allowVertexSpread = on
!Beams:sigmaVertexX = 0.1
!Beams:sigmaVertexY = 0.1
!Beams:sigmaVertexZ = 4.
!Beams:maxDevVertex = 5.
!Beams:sigmaTime = 4.
!Beams:maxDevTime = 5.

!!! there are a CRAPLOAD of settings for production processes,
!!! but only a few are documented here, 'cause i am tired.

HardQCD:all = on

!!! ____________________________________________________________
!!! ATTENTION: PARTON DISTRIBUTION FUNCTIONS ARE VERY IMPORTANT!
!!! ------------------------------------------------------------
!!! at least, the authors of PYTHIA think
!!! that you should put a lot of thought
!!! into your choice.
!!! ...i am new to this stuff do not ask me :P

!!! built-in p and pbar PDFs
!PDF:pSet = 2

!!! LHAPDF6 is a C++ library for more PDF choices
!PDF:useLHAPDF = on
!PDF:LHAPDFset = blah_blah_blah.LHgrid
!PDF:LHAPDFmember = 0
!PDF:extrapolateLHAPDF = off

!!! can choose different PDF for hard process only
!PDFuseHard = off

!!! choose PDF for pions and pomerons...
!PDF:piSet = 1
!PDF:PomSet = 6

!!! if you want a nice quiet run...
Init:showMultipartonInteractions = off
Init:showChangedSettings = off
Init:showChangedParticleData = off
Next:numberCount = 0
Next:numberShowLHA = 0
Next:numberShowInfo = 0
Next:numberShowProcess = 0
Next:numberShowEvent = 0
Stat:showProcessLevel = off
Stat:showErrors = off

!!! still prints the PYTHIA splash screen, though :P

!!! for some reason, PYTHIA/PHPythia8 will not run
!!! if this guy is turned off.
!Init:showProcess = off

!!! no effect... PHPythia8 handles this for you.
!Main:numberOfEvents = 1000








!__________________________________________________________________
! there are lots more settings, but i am tired now
! and will not explicitly put more effort
! into recording more. so, check the docs.
! 
! i will try to update this file as i use PYTHIA more,
! and i encourage you to record settings
! that you find useful.
! 
! ...seriously please there are a ton
! ...and i do not want to scan through
! ...all of them.
! 
! in particular, i would be interested
!_in phase-space cuts._____________________________________________
