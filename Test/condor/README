NAME
	condor/ -- (pseudo-)minimum working example for running condor jobs

DESCRIPTION
	these files are meant to give a small working example
	on how to submit condor jobs to the RCF.
	
	.
	|-- README
	|-- err/
	|	`-- 1 2 3 4 5 6
	|-- fiddle
	|-- fiddle.job
	|-- log/
	|	`-- 1 2 3 4 5 6
	`-- out/
		`-- 1 2 3 4 5 6
	
	fiddle.job is the most important file. it contains
	commands that tell condor to run the script
	fiddle on the RCF, several times, with different
	arguments. running
		
		$ condor_submit fiddle.job
	
	submits the jobs. when they are run, they will fill
	the numbered files under err/ log/ and out/
	you can check when they are finished by
	looking at the log files. alternatively, run
		
		$ condor_q | grep $USER
	
	i recommend
	(1) cleaning out err/ log/ and out/
	(2) making sure that you can run fiddle.job
	(3) screwing with fiddle.job and fiddle
	
	it will probably be necessary to first go into
	fiddle.job to modify the Initialdir macro
	to match your working directory.
