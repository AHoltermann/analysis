when: when did i notice the bug?
where: whereabouts can i find the bug?
what: what bit of code is causing the bug?
why: why is that code buggy?
workaround: how can i live with the bug?

when: 20170710
where: line 9 of G4_CEmc_Spacal.C
what: use of symbol PHG4CylinderGeom_Spacalv1::k2DProjectiveSpacal
why: symbol is defined in libg4detectors.so, but that library is not loaded yet
workaround: load libg4detectors.so **before loading G4_CEmc_Spacal.C**

when: 20170710
where: line 40 of G4_EEMC.C
what: call to PHG4CrystalCalorimeterSubsystem::SetAbsorberActive()
why: method does not exist
workaround: comment out the line (for absorberactive of 0, need to do more hacking)

when: 20170714
where: line 129 of G4Setup_EICDetector.C
what: in G4Setup(), do_FEMC and do_FHCAL default to false
why: this does not correctly describe the EIC detector
workaround: override the defaults

note: i am not sure that G4Setup_EICDetector.C is right macro to use for the EIC detector.
      for example, uses the fsPHENIX FEMC instead of EIC detector FEMC.
