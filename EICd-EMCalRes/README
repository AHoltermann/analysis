NAME
	eicplots/ - energy resolution plots for EIC detector

DESCRIPTION
	this makes energy resolution plots for EICd's electromagnetic calorimeters.
	it evaluates their performance on electrons and positrons.
	
	energy resolution (dE/E) is computed by...
		
		specifying the truth energies (E) of a large number of electrons.
		simulating the electrons' production in EICd
		simulating the electrons' interaction with EICd
		reconstructing the electrons' energies
		dividing the reconstructed energies by the truth energies
		histogramming that ratio
		fitting the histogram to a gaussian
		extracting the gaussian's standard deviation
	
	compute energy resolution differentially in bins of...
		
		energy
		flavor
		pseudorapidity

	this README gave a brief sketch of what this project does.
	for a more detailed description, read spec.
	for a step-by-step guide on how to use this code, read WORKFLOW.
	
	most of the code that does real work
	for this project
	is stored under macro/ or src/
	macro/ is for ROOT macros
	that will be interpreted by CINT,
	src/ is for compiled modules.
	
	since a lot of this project involved huge amounts of simulated data,
	it uses condor extensively
	to leverage the power of RCF's computing clusters.
	files relevant to using condor are stored under condor/
	most of the condor jobs are run large numbers of times
	with lots of different arguments.
	i use scripts to generate those argument lists,
	and those scripts are stored under util/
	the argument lists are also in util/
	
	all the internal data files,
	as well as quality assurance files
	and output plots
	are stored under data/
