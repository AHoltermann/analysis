read this, i guess??

to re-compile everything, do like
	
	$ cd build/
	$ ../autogen.sh --prefix="$MYINSTALL"
	$ make ; make install
	$ cd ..
	$ ./clean.sh

clean.sh is just 'cause i hate having a bunch of left-over build files
laying around my source code directory.
heck, i hate having autogen.sh and LinkDef.h files and whatever else around,
but i am not really sure how to get rid of those.

anyway......

the ClusterPeeler class is used in g42rc.C
it peels cluster data off the PHOOL node tree.
