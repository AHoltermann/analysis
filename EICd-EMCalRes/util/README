NAME
	util/ - utilities for working with lots of data files

DESCRIPTION
	right now, i am using...
		
		2 electron flavors
		9 pseudorapidity bins (3 calorimeters)
		9 energy bins
	
	with 10 G4 files for each parameter tuple,
	i have to deal with 1,620 argument sets
	when i submit my G4 condor jobs.
	it is way easier to write scripts to do this
	than to try to manage these files manually.
	
	so, that is what this subdirectory is for!
	
	the basic file types are...
		
		make_table_*.sh
			regenerate an ASCII file
			to feed to a condor job's
			"Queue Arguments From <file>"
			command.
		
		table_*
			those ASCII files i was talking about.
		
		make_file[s]_*.sh
			sometimes, i need to generate
			a whole bunch of table files.
			other times, i need to generate
			a bunch of skeleton ROOT files
			'cause no one job is responsible for creating the files.
		
		make_file_*.C
			a ROOT CINT macro
			that actually does the real work
			of creating a skeleton file.
	
	***WARNING!*** no script in this directory takes arguments,
	and all scripts must be run from this directory.

	make_table.sh produces table.
	table is the source and wellspring of life
	for all the other table generation scripts.
	
	the rest of the make_table_*.sh files
	map pretty regularly onto their ASCII files.
		
		g4 .. arguments for make_g4
		rc .. arguments for g42rc
		de .. arguments for rc2de
		pa .. arguments for de2pa
	
	the XEMC files run these CINT macros with special arguments
	that clump pseudorapidities together
	by which calorimeter they correspond to.
	
	make_table_g4_failures.sh is a special case.
	since G4 condor jobs fail so often,
	there is this special script
	that tries to figure out which jobs failed
	and make a list of their arguments to re-run on condor.
	it has some kinks, though,
	so **be sure to double-check** that it caught everything!
	if it ever screws up,
	try starting clean with make_table_g4.sh
	and then running make_table_g4_failures.sh again.
	
	make_table_rc_failures.sh is similar.
	lately, i have had issues
	where g42rc jobs take forever to run.
	rather than wait,
	it is faster to just
	kill them and re-submit.
	
	make_files_de.sh, which calls make_file_de.C,
	should be run before generating new DE files.
	make_file_pa.sh, which calls make_file_pa.C,
	should be run before regenerating the PA file.
	
	make_everything.sh re-generates all the tables
	and re-creates all the skeleton files.
