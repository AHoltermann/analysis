NAME
	condor/ - files for running jobs

DESCRIPTION
	mostly basic condor crap for running jobs on computing farms.
	some *.csh scripts do all computations locally, though.
	
	for the most part, each *.csh shell script
	calls one *.C ROOT macro that lives in ../macro/
	this is not quite the case with rc2de.csh, however.
	
	also, this directory contains two special utilities:
		
		submit.sh
		checkdone.sh
	
	you do not need to use them,
	but i wrote them
	so i know what they do
	so i think that they are useful.

DIRECTORY STRUCTURE

	|-- README
	|-- check_pa.csh
	|-- checkdone.sh
	|-- de2pa.csh
	|-- de2pa.job
	|-- de2pa_XEMC.csh
	|-- de2pa_XEMC.job
	|-- err/

	|-- rc2de.csh
	|-- rc2de.job
	|-- rc2de_XEMC.csh
	|-- rc2de_XEMC.job
	`-- submit.sh
	
	err/ log/ and out/ hold the output
	and logs of the condor jobs.
	
	each *.csh script has a *.job file.
	except for check_pa.csh and pa2pr_XEMC.csh .. those have no job files.
	each *.job file links to a table_* file in ../util/
		
		g4 .. generate GEANT4 files
		rc .. reconstruct calorimeter clusters
		de .. compute energy resolution
		pa .. fit energy resolution curves
		pr .. make publication-quality plots
	
	the XEMC files do not look at particles differentially in pseudorapidity.
	instead, they look at particles differentially in calorimeter.
	
	submit.sh is convenience script for clearing
	log/ and err/ and out/
	before submitting a new set of jobs.
	
	checkdone.sh sorts through the log files
	to see which ones do not mention the word
	"terminate".
	if it comes up empty, it means that all your jobs
	are probably done.
	using condor_q every five minutes is frowned upon,
	so checkdone.sh checks with just local data.
	check with
		
		$ condor_q $USER
	
	to be sure that everything is done.
