The truthconversion package uses truth information to identify photon conversions and saves information about the conversion to a TTree. The conversions are then associated with RawClusters and the TreeMaker class makes a second TTree with cluster and tower information. The macro titled cluster_burner will run the package. It takes a DST input file and a title for the output trees. A run number can also be designated. If the user does not want both TTrees that can be edited in the macro.
