power cycle ALPIDEs
run 65: trigger delay=0x50 clocks, strobe width=20 clocks, same ALPIDE frontend settings as above

requests for OM improvements:

* change the idx diff plots to use chip 3 as a reference, so the plots still make sense when chip 0 has noisy pixels

evening 2018-03-06: INTT is taking 120 GeV protons at ~14k counts on the SC123 scintillators, ~8k triggers/spill
run 66 is empty, run 67 has arbiter=0x3 (only chips 0 and 3)
run 68: same settings as run 65, data looks good
run 69: same settings as above, calibration run
run 70: calibration run, trigger delay=0x50 clocks, strobe width=20 clocks, ITHR=50, IDB=29, VCASN=50, VCASN2=57, IBIAS=64, VCASP=86, VCLIP=0, VRESETD=147 (defaults from git, new-alpide-software ConfigTemplate.cfg)
run 71: same settings, calib run
run 72-75: masked noisy pixels on chip 0
run 76: pulser was left on, junk
run 77: normal run, we notice the beam spot is in the corner row=0 col=1024
run 79: moved box down ~1cm to bring beam closer to the center of the chip. Beam now centered off right edge of chip ~(474,268)
run 82: good run with large statistics

2018-03-07
during the day, the telescope was moved from the 80-20 stand to a platform
run 83:empty run, did not get beam
1702: replaced chip ID 0 with the new ALPIDE bonded by SiDet
run 84, 85: calib with new chip, chip does not seem to work
run 86: revert to old chip 0, works
run 87: waiting for beam
run 88: we see a beamspot
run 89: Placed single lead brick in front of the box oriented with its face normal to the beam axis. 2 in thick or ~0.3 interaction lengths
Added three more bricks: 8 in, 1.2 interaction lengths
swapped in the SiDet ALPIDE again
run 90: calib, pulser, still looks bad (chip ID 2 is unplugged)
swapped back
run 91: beam with four bricks: primary beam is reduced, background is increased, looks like the high-multiplicity events are being attenuated
